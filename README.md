# Time-series
This paper was supervised by professor Rongmao Zhang in Zhejiang university in Dec. 2017. It was written in Chinese. It is the course work of Nonlinear time series analysis.

This paper was mainly about the fitting of time series for the Chinese market. I used ARMA model to fit the trend and then test it. Also, try to predict the market. ARMA can explain much of at least this stock I chose.
